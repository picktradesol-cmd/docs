# $PICK

The official Pick Trade token is **$PICK**. It is a deflationary token launched on the Solana blockchain and serves multiple purposes.

### Characteristics

$PICK is deployed as a fairlaunch token with no tax fees. Both the total supply and circulating supply remain unchanged at launch, ensuring that the market cap is equal to the fully diluted value. However, a **deflationary system** has been established to reduce the supply over time, increasing the rarity and value of each token held by users.

The deflationary mechanism operates in conjunction with the [treasury](treasury.md), which grows over time and enables the Pick Trade team to continuously buy back $PICK and burn a portion of it.

### Utility

Since Pick.trade is a gamified dApp, there needs to be a main currency at the core of the platform to power the [gamified features](../../the-platform/images-and-media.md) and rewards system.

$PICK is used to leverage these gamified features and is also distributed as an [incentive](../incentives.md) for users and token creators. The more users interact on Pick Trade, the more points they earn, allowing them to unlock exclusive perks and additional $PICK tokens.

_All features available on Pick.trade remain free and do not require holding any $PICK._

### Tokenomics

Since $PICK is launched as a **fairlaunch**, no supply is held or locked to support the model promoted by the platform. Nearly all the supply is liquid at launch and remains tradable. However, the team is securing 30% of the supply for the following purposes:

* Establishing an initial treasury
* Airdrop
* CEX listings

Additionally, the [treasury](treasury.md) is consistently funded through revenue from platform fees, premiums from boosts and advertising tokens and donation fees from [live-streamed videos](../../the-platform/video-live-streams/). 10% of this treasury is used to continuously **buy back $PICK**, with 5% of that amount being burned.
