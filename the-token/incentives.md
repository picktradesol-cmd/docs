# Incentives

At Pick Trade, one of our focuses is to reward users and $PICK holders. This is achieved through a [deflationary mechanism](usdpick/) for the $PICK token, as well as rewards based on levels, contest winners and airdrops.

For each level a user achieves through trading and interacting on [Pick.trade](https://pick.trade/), they receive **various rewards**. These rewards may include platform advantages, accessories for their avatar or incentives primarily distributed in $PICK tokens. The specific rewards will be revealed at each level earned by the users.

$PICK can also be earned through contests and giveaways that the team frequently hosts.

Some giveaways may be organized internally or in partnership with others. For example, we are hosting a giveaway at the public platform's launch where the first token to attract at least 250 viewers on its [live-stream](../the-platform/video-live-streams/) will earn $1,000. (As a reminder, developers can launch live-streams for any token on Solana, it doesnâ€™t have to be a token launched through Pick Trade.) The same applies to the first token launched on [Pick.trade](https://pick.trade/) that reaches a market cap of $1 million.

### Contests

We will also host contests to add more fun and competition among users, similar to those in video games.

### Airdrops

Some airdrops will occur randomly to reward our most loyal community members and platform users.

_Our goal is to establish a lasting platform that continuously evolves. To achieve this, we recognize the importance of providing incentives to our users._
