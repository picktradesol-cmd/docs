# Roadmap

The team is driven by a commitment to address the gaps existing in current platforms by providing a richer and more versatile **trading ecosystem**. This comprehensive approach involves aggregating the strengths of various platforms built on Solana like PumpFun, Jupiter, Axiom and others, to create a robust solution that caters to both new and experienced traders.&#x20;

The goal is not just to replicate existing platforms, but to elevate them by introducing advanced features and seamless integration, providing users with an unparalleled experience.

We are going to make token creation and on-chain trading easier while enhancing fun and accessibility.

### Token Creation

* Expanding the range of options for creating different token types
* Providing tools for managing token supply (lock, burn, etc)
* Offering additional services to assist with token development
* Developing more features for video live-streaming such as live interactions
* Supporting a wider variety of launchpads, including those from other blockchains

### On-chain Trading

* Developing a more comprehensive set of trading tools
* Creating additional perks and features for the reward system
* Adding some trading-related games
* Offering both Pro and Light versions
* Developing a mobile app
* Enabling multichain trading

### Pro & Light Version

Our target audience includes both beginners and experienced traders. For this reason, we plan to develop **two versions**: a Pro and a Light version.

The Pro version will feature multiple advanced screeners, adjustable trading settings, scraping tools and more.&#x20;

Meanwhile, the Light version will offer simple interactions for buying and selling any token with ease. This includes options to purchase with a bank card, receive tutorial assistance if needed, set up auto-slippage and priority fees and more.

### Gamification & Mobile App Development

To enhance user engagement and accessibility, we plan to significantly **improve** our **gamification** **features**. By incorporating more badges, competitions, perks and rewards, we aim to deliver the same dopamine rush associated with video games, specifically tailored for on-chain trading.

We also plan to develop some on-chain games, such as « Predictions » or « Lottery », which are attractive, easy and fun to play.

Additionally, we are committed to developing a robust mobile app, free and accessible on all smartphones, to support our growth.

### Multichain Integration

Our ultimate goal is to establish a comprehensive trading platform across multiple blockchains, focusing only on the most impactful ones such as Base or Hyperliquid.

Our multichain approach facilitates global access, allowing users to create or trade any token seamlessly, without the hassle of cross-chain complexities.
