# How it works

## As a Token Creator

1. If you wish to create a token, you simply have to click on the « Create » button and fill in all the fields with the token details you wish to provide.
2. After that, you'll have the choice to deploy your token on any launchpad you wish. Each launchpad offers a different range of rewards (also called creator rewards) that will be given to the developer's wallet. You can compare these rates with our [comparison tool](../the-platform/interactive-blocks/launchpad-rate.md).
3. Once created, you can leave it as is or opt for one of the [extra services](../the-platform/interactive-blocks/level-up-your-token.md) that Pick Trade offers to level up your token.
4. Then, you can manage your position and supply alongside the chart of your token.
5. You can also launch a [video live-stream](../the-platform/video-live-streams/how-it-works.md) or interact with your holders through the [chat](../the-platform/video-live-streams/chat-and-moderation.md) section. You can even grant admin rights to people to moderate your chat.

Don’t forget to claim your creator fees on Pick.trade and the underlying launchpad.

## As a Trader

1. As a trader, you can go through the [Pick Zone](../the-platform/interactive-blocks/pick-zone.md) to scout for tokens. To help you find the next gem, you can also use our unique [gem filter](../the-platform/interactive-blocks/gem-filter.md).
2. By clicking on any token, you'll be able to analyze and trade it.
3. You can also interact with others through a dedicated [chat](../the-platform/video-live-streams/chat-and-moderation.md) available on each token's page on the platform.
4. Your profile section will help you keep an eye on your trade history, positions and [XP earned](../the-platform/images-and-media.md).
