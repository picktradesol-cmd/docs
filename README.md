# What's Pick.trade? sync

Pick Trade is a decentralized platform that allows anyone to trade, create and interact with **any token** on the Solana blockchain.

As a developer, you can deploy a token on your chosen launchpad: PumpFun, LetsBonk, Boop, Believe,  Moonit or Moonshot directly from [Pick.trade](https://pick.trade/) to gain more incentives and access exclusive features to [boost](the-platform/interactive-blocks/level-up-your-token.md) and promote your token. Additionally, you can host [video live-streams](the-platform/video-live-streams/), open a [chat](the-platform/video-live-streams/chat-and-moderation.md) section and interact with your holders. As an investor, you can trade using advanced [tools](the-platform/interactive-blocks/) while continuously earn points, along with [incentives](the-token/incentives.md) and exclusive perks.

Our dApp provides all the features found in the top trading platforms on Solana, delivering a unique **set of tools** unmatched by others.
