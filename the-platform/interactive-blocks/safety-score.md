# Safety score

We have integrated a Safety score for every token on the Solana blockchain into our platform. This scoring system is a vital tool for **assessing the potential risks of investments**.

By evaluating tokens based on 10 distinct criteria such as liquidity, top holders or even LP providers, the Safety score efficiently consolidates essential information to determine the risk level associated with trading each token.

A lower score, such as 0/10, indicates that a token carries minimal risk although price action remains an inherent factor.

Importantly, a high score does not necessarily mean a token is unfavorable, nor does a low score guarantee a profitable investment.

This analytical tool is especially useful for **examining low-cap tokens**, streamlining the decision making process for traders by compiling key evaluation metrics into a single, time saving score.
