# Pick Zone

The Pick Zone is a comprehensive **screener** that **scans tokens** across the launchpads. You can manage the display using filters and analyze dozens of tokens in the blink of an eye, providing a streamlined view of token activity.

The Pick Zone is divided into three sections:

1. **New:** A list of the latest tokens deployed from launchpads like PumpFun.
2. **About to Migrate:** A list of tokens that are nearing the completion of their bonding curve.
3. **Freshly Migrated:** A list of tokens that have just completed their migration process.

This format not only optimizes the identification of promising tokens but also consolidates essential information into a single, user-friendly interface, making it a valuable resource for traders.
