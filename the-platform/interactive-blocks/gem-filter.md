# Gem filter

Our team has developed an advanced filter that allows users to find **early gems** simply by observing our bot in action. Unlike the « Pick Zone » this feature highlights only low-cap tokens with the **greatest potential for growth**.

It's designed to help users discover promising low-cap tokens early and it stands as a breakthrough in crypto analysis.&#x20;

Leveraging blockchain data and project information, it combines gem indicators from different platforms with **AI-enhanced optimization** to select the best candidates with high growth potential.&#x20;

The bot swiftly evaluates critical aspects of each token and its developer, including past launches, narrative strength, influential X accounts and ongoing bundles. Frequent appearances of a token in this filter indicate strong compliance with these criteria, increasing its likelihood of success.

This gem filter streamlines the search for potential 100x tokens.
