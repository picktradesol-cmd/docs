# Terms and conditions

## Livestream Moderation Policy

**Purpose**: To cultivate a social environment on [Pick.trade](https://pick.trade/) that preserves creativity and freedom of expression and encourages meaningful engagement amongst users, free of illegal, harmful, and negative interactions. We consider this moderation policy to be a living document and may update it in the future and in response to feedback from the community, moderators, policy experts, and other stakeholders.

### Prohibited Content

Streams containing any of the following are prohibited and subject to immediate termination and suspension of future access to pick trade livestreams or to pick trade itself:

* **Violence:** Graphic violence, threats, glorification of violent acts, or content promoting self-harm
* **Harassment:** Targeted abuse, bullying, or coordinated harassment campaigns
* **Sexual Content:** Pornography, nudity without context, sexual exploitation, or the promotion of sexual violence
* **Under Age Use:** Livestreaming by anyone under the age of 18.
* **Youth Endangerment:** Content promoting or constituting child sexual abuse material (“CSAM”), or content that promotes or depicts the sexual exploitation or grooming of children. All CSAM discovered on the platform will be reported to law enforcement, where possible.
* **Illegal Activities:** Content promoting illicit behavior or violations of the law
* **Privacy Violations:** Sharing personal information without consent, doxxing (i.e. the unauthorized association of a person’s identity with their online handle or persona), or unauthorized broadcasting of private individuals’ likenesses
* **Copyright Violations:** Unauthorized broadcasting of protected content, trademarked content or the use of intellectual property belonging to another person without permission
* **Terrorism or Violent Extremism:** Glorification of or encouragement of acts which would cause harm to others or significant harm to property

### Appropriateness of Content

Aside from the prohibitions listed above, pick trade does not intend to universally define what content is ‘appropriate’ or ‘inappropriate.’ There is an implicit assumption that some content - perhaps much content - generally defined as NSFW will in fact appear on pick trade. Pick trade reserves the right to unilaterally determine the appropriateness of content where necessary and to moderate it accordingly.

### Enforcement

Violation of this policy may result in termination of livestreams and user account(s). This policy is enforced at the sole discretion of pick.trade. While our moderators work diligently to ensure that this policy is not violated, we may not discover every violation of this policy. The publication of material which violates this policy and is not discovered by our moderators does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce this policy, in its entirety, to any subsequently posted content. Content determined to violate these rules will be removed. pick trade reserves the right to ban any user violating these rules and to make appropriate referrals to law enforcement if any posted content violates the law.

### Creator Responsabilities

* Follow the moderation policy.
* Review moderation guidelines before streaming sensitive topics.

### Appeals Process

We acknowledge that mistakes may be made in enforcing this policy and, to the extent a user believes that their content has been mistakenly removed and does not violate this policy, such user may appeal the removal of their content by contacting "pick support" via the link on the pick.trade homepage. However, pick trade retains the ultimate discretion to determine whether content violates this policy.
