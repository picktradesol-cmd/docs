# How it works

[Pick.trade](https://pick.trade/) revolutionizes the way developers can engage with their community by offering an easy-to-use video live streaming feature for **any token** launched on Solana.&#x20;

By simply connecting their wallet, developers can effortlessly broadcast via screen sharing or webcam on their token's page, enhancing direct communication with their audience.

This innovation allows a more interactive and engaging experience for investors and users. Although the current service supports single video streams, an expansion to **multi video streaming** is anticipated to enhance collaborative interactions in the future.
