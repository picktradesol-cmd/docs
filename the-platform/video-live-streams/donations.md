# Donations

Pick Trade offers a novel way for developers to **receive donations in real-time** while engaging with their community.&#x20;

This feature allows any user/trader to tip their favorite streamers or coin developers instantly, similar to how Twitch operates but faster, cheaper and in a decentralized manner.

Developers can receive donations regardless of whether their token was launched through [Pick.trade](https://pick.trade/). These donations are facilitated using the Solana ($SOL) token ensuring swift transactions that are completed in seconds.

### How It Works?

It operates like a standard streaming platform. Any developer who has launched a token on Solana can initiate a [video live-stream](./) on [Pick.trade](https://pick.trade/), which traders can access from the homepage.&#x20;

During the stream, viewers can easily send donations to the developer's wallet using the official Solana token ($SOL), enabling the developer to **receive the funds instantly**.

_Developers should note that Pick Trade takes a 10% commission on each donation, which is added to the_ [_treasury_](https://app.gitbook.com/o/fbzw88TiGbt9JjI71hLG/s/1qi0P2CYqb07w0SGAGHL/~/changes/88/the-token/usdpick/deflationary-and-treasury) _to support the platform's development._
