# Chat & Moderation

A chat feature is also available on every token's page, allowing anyone to **freely communicate** with others while engaging with Pick Trade.

This chat section ensures that all users, regardless of whether they hold a specific token, can participate and engage with other traders. This open-access communication allows for a more inclusive environment where developers and holders can interact seamlessly.&#x20;

Developers have the ability to manage chat functionalities, including deleting messages or banning participants to maintain a constructive and respectful space. They can also **add moderators** to assist in managing the chat.

This setup not only fosters community involvement but also enhances transparency and real-time information sharing with the holders.
