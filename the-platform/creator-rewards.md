# Creator rewards

When launching a token on Pick Trade, the first launchpad aggregator, developers must select the desired launchpad for token deployment.

Each developer using Pick Trade for token deployment receives **two types of creator rewards**:

1. **Rewards from the chosen launchpad**: Developers can select from PumpFun, Let'sBonk, Boop, Believe App, Moonit or Moonshot, each offering varied creator reward structures. They can compare these options using our [comparison tool](interactive-blocks/launchpad-rate.md).
2. **Rewards from Pick.trade**: Developers earn a 50% fee rebate from every transaction (buy/sell) processed on their token through [Pick.trade](https://pick.trade/).

Thus, a developer that launched his token through Pick Trade will get more creator rewards coming both from Pick Trade and the underlying launchpad.
