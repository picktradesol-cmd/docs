# Mobile version

Pick Trade is also **available on mobile** with a dedicated version.&#x20;

For now, it's a responsive version with a UI/UX that adapts to any smartphone, but a web app version will be available soon. From there, you'll be able to enjoy [Pick.trade](https://pick.trade/) through your phone by adding the website to your homescreen.

Although this offers convenience, the team is considering the development of a dedicated **mobile app** for both Android and iOS, which will enhance user experience beyond the planned webapp.

This would provide a more integrated and optimized service, ensuring seamless trading on the go.
